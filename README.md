# LDB
This is a lua debugger i try to make like GDB,PDB and the name is LDB !.this is easy to use and small and use no lib and if you find any bugs pls tell me.
only run it like ldb.exe or lua ldb.lua yourluafile.lua then run h for help then you have all commands and the executable build with srlua and srglue and compress with upx and the antivirus can flag it but this is safe and if you don't trust me then  you can use the lua source file and compile it your self thanks.Happy Debugging.(*^*)
